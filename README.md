# CSC8498-Procedural-Planets
The general idea behind this project is to randomly generate planets within space. They will have a random size, random terrain, random colours etc. I also want to implement certain Level of Detail components so that the detail one all the planets will change based on the distance between the camera (or player) and the planet.
